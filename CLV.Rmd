This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
# variables 
purchase_frequency <- 3 # times per week
average_purchase_value <- 6.45 # dollars 
customer_lifespan <- 5 # years 
revenue_threshold <- 2000 # dollars 
profit_margin <- 0.25 

# Calculate the annual revenue and profit
annual_revenue <- purchase_frequency * average_purchase_value * 52
annual_profit <- annual_revenue * profit_margin

# Calculate the CLV
if (annual_revenue * customer_lifespan > revenue_threshold) 
{
clv <- (annual_revenue - annual_profit) * customer_lifespan 
} else { 
clv <- 0 
} 

# Print the CLV 
cat("The CLV for this customer is $", format(clv, digits = 6), ".", sep = "")

```

```{r}
```

```{r}

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
